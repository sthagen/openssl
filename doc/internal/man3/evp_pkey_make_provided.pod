=head1 NAME

evp_pkey_make_provided - internal EVP_PKEY support functions for providers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 /* Only for EVP source */
 #include "evp_local.h"

 void *evp_pkey_make_provided(EVP_PKEY *pk, OPENSSL_CTX *libctx,
                              EVP_KEYMGMT **keymgmt, const char *propquery);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

evp_pkey_make_provided() ensures that the B<EVP_PKEY> I<pk> is provided within
the library context I<libctx> (NULL means the default context).  I<keymgmt>
may point at a reference to a B<EVP_KEYMGMT>, and works as an input/output
parameter.
As input to this function, it can be used to specify a B<EVP_KEYMGMT> to be
used for exporting.  If not (I<*keymgmt> is NULL), then this function will
fetch an B<EVP_KEYMGMT> implicitly, using I<propquery> as property query string.
As output from this function, I<*keymgmt> will be assigned the B<EVP_KEYMGMT>
that was used, if the export was successful, otherwise it will be assigned NULL.

If I<pk> has an assigned legacy key, a check is done to see if any of
its key material has changed since last export, by comparing the
result of the legacy key's dirty_cnt() method with a copy of that
result from last time evp_pkey_make_provided() was run with this
B<EVP_PKEY>.
If it has, the cache of already exported keys is cleared, and a new
export is made with the new legacy key material.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

evp_pkey_make_provided() returns the provider key data that was exported if
I<pk> was successfully provided.  Otherwise, NULL is returned.

=head1 NOTES

Some functions calling evp_pkey_make_provided() may have received a const
key, and may therefore have to cast the key to non-const form to call this
function.  Since B<EVP_PKEY> is always dynamically allocated, this is OK.
